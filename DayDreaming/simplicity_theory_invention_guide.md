# Simplicity Theory and Invention  
*A clear guide for inventors and innovators*

## 1. What is Simplicity Theory?

Simplicity Theory explains why some inventions feel like breakthroughs:  
An invention is “amazing” if it suddenly makes a result easy that used to be hard (or impossible).

It measures this using two key ideas:
- **Generation complexity (Cw):** How complicated it was to get the result *before* your invention.
- **Description complexity (C):** How simply you can describe the result itself.

The “wow factor” (U) is the difference:  
**U = Cw − C**

All of this depends on how someone living before your invention saw the world.

## 2. Why do inventions excite us?

- **Before your invention:**  
  Cw is big. The result is hard or even impossible.

- **After your invention:**  
  Cw drops. Now it’s easy!

**The bigger the drop, the more impressive your invention is.**

## 3. How to use this for your idea

1. **Describe the outcome** you want (e.g. “a room lit at night, safely and instantly”).
2. **Estimate C:** How simply can you describe that result?
3. **Estimate Cw, before:** How hard was it to achieve this *before* your invention, given all the requirements?
4. **Estimate Cw, after:** How hard is it to achieve now, with your invention?
5. **Calculate the difference:**  
   ΔCw = Cw_before − Cw_after  
   (The bigger the difference, the more “wow.”)

## 4. Example: The Electric Light

| Situation                                                | Generation complexity (Cw) | What it means                                                               |
|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Easy spec: “some indoor light”                           | Modest                    | Oil/gas lamps did the job, just add fuel and light the wick.                 |
| Moderate spec: “indoor light that’s safe or odorless”    | High (~100 bits)          | Old tech was possible but hard: required careful attention, ventilation, etc.|
| Strict spec: “steady, odorless, cool, instant, safe, etc.” | Infinite                  | No known method could meet all demands; it was impossible before Edison.      |
| After Edison’s light bulb                                | Low (~7 bits)             | Now it’s simple: just set voltage, filament, bulb type…                      |

> **Framing matters:**  
> The generation complexity before your invention (**Cw, before**) depends on the requirements you set for the outcome.  
> - If you only ask for “some light,” old solutions are easy (Cw modest).  
> - Add just one strict demand—like “safe” or “odorless”—and Cw jumps.  
> - If your requirements are strict enough, the old world couldn’t deliver at all (Cw is infinite).  
>  
> **The stricter the requirements, the bigger the “wow factor” when your invention makes it possible.**

## 5. Common mistake to avoid

**Don’t mix up the invention’s design complexity with generation complexity (Cw).**

- **Cw is about how hard it was to get the result *before* your invention,** not how complicated your invention is.

**Tip:**  
When estimating Cw, always look at the world *before* your invention.  
If you’re using an LLM, say:  
> “Generation complexity means how hard it was to get the result before the invention—not how complex the invention itself is.”
