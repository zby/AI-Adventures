# Behind the Scenes: Why I'm Publishing My AI Writing Process

**The main takeaway**: Traditional writing hides the messy reality of research, revision, and iteration. But when AI becomes your writing partner, that process gets exponentially more complex—and potentially more interesting than the final articles themselves.

Look at what most people see when I publish an article like my recent critique of [Gwern's AI daydreaming proposal](https://github.com/zby/AI-Adventures/DayDreaming/DayDreaming.md): a polished 4,000-word technical analysis with clean arguments building from simple concepts to complex frameworks.

What they don't see is everything that happened before that final version: hours of background research, multiple drafts, [detailed revision todos](https://github.com/zby/AI-Adventures/DayDreaming/article-revision-todo.md) addressing logical gaps, and painful restructuring when early drafts missed the mark.

## Why AI Changes Everything

When you introduce AI into serious writing, the process doesn't just get faster—it gets fundamentally different. And here's the bigger shift: **more and more of my blog will be written by AI, not by me.**

This isn't about using AI as a research assistant or editor. I'm talking about AI as the primary author, with me providing direction, critique, and quality control. Consider what's already happening:

**AI-Powered Critique**: My revision todo list shows this working—an AI reviewer caught three critical logical flaws in my Darwin argument that I completely missed. Instead of vague "make this better" feedback, I got specific, actionable revision tasks targeting precise logical gaps.

**Research Integration**: AI tools can compile background research that would take weeks to gather manually, freeing time for synthesis and original thinking.

**Version Control for Ideas**: Just like tracking code changes, I'm starting to track how arguments evolve. When AI suggests restructuring a section, I want to preserve both the original reasoning and the new approach.

The writing process is becoming something like software development: highly iterative, with multiple "builds," extensive testing (critique), and systematic debugging (revision).

## The Transparency Experiment

I'm considering making much of this process public.

Instead of hiding the messy iteration behind polished final drafts, what if I published the intermediary materials that show how technical articles actually get created when AI is involved? Things like:

- Research reports from AI tools that inform initial argument structure
- Draft versions showing how arguments evolve through AI critique  
- Planning documents that show the thinking process before writing begins
- Version diffs tracking how key arguments change through iteration

Why expose this complexity? Mostly because I want to save it in a revision control system - but the writing process itself is becoming a form of human-AI collaboration that might deserve documentation.


## The Bigger Picture

Traditional writing optimizes for hiding complexity. But when AI becomes the primary author, everything changes—we need to optimize for managing that complexity systematically.

As AI writes more of our content, the "secret sauce" isn't in the final output—it's in how you orchestrate the collaboration. The methodology matters as much as the results. The human skill shifts from writing to directing, critiquing, and quality control.
